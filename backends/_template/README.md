# Backend Template

This folder is a copy-and-rename starting point for a new backend.

How to use:
1) Copy this folder to `backends/<name>`.
2) Rename files in `src/` from `template_*` to `<name>_*`.
3) Replace occurrences of "template" in the code with your backend name.
4) Add your backend's emit logic.
5) Place it under `backends/<name>` (or `backends/ext/<name>`) and build; auto-registration is generated by Makefiles.

See `README.md` for backend extension and discovery contracts.
