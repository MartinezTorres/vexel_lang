# Vexel Web Playground

This folder contains a fully client-side playground. The compiler runs in the browser via WebAssembly and emits backend output files for visualization. The built `docs/playground.html` is self-contained (compiler embedded).

## Build (Emscripten required)

```bash
source /path/to/emsdk_env.sh
make web
```

This produces:

- `playground/vexel.js`
- `playground/vexel.wasm`
- `docs/playground.html` (self-contained, ready to copy to another machine)

## Run locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs/
```

or directly:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs/playground.html
```

Notes:

- Process expressions are disabled by default; the playground does not pass `--allow-process`.
- The playground always invokes the compiler with an explicit backend (`-b <name>`).
- The playground writes source files into an in-memory filesystem and reads back generated output files.
- `playground/playground.template.html` is the editable source; `docs/playground.html` is generated by `make web`.
- The top bar includes **Copy Share URL** to encode current sources + backend into a URL query parameter.
